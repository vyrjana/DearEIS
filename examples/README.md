# Examples

The `example-data.csv` file contains the impedance response generated by a circuit (test circuit 1 or TC-1) that was used in the article "A linear Kronig-Kramers transform test for immittance data validation" by B.A. Boukamp (DOI:10.1149/1.2044210).

The `example-project.json` file contains the example data with and without added noise, some analysis results, and some plots.

The `examples.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how one could use the API of DearEIS.
