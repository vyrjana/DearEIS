## Version 3.1.3

[Link to this release.](https://github.com/vyrjana/DearEIS/releases/tag/3.1.3)

- Fixed bugs that caused the toggling of a plottable series (e.g., a data set or a Kramers-Kronig test result) in the `Plotting` tab to apply the change to the wrong plot under certain circumstances.
- Fixed bugs that caused a failure to properly adjust the axis limits in cases where the difference between the maximum and minimum values being plotted was zero or all values were zero.
