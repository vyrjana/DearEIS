## Version 2.2.0

[Link to this release.](https://github.com/vyrjana/DearEIS/releases/tag/2.2.0)

- Added `num_per_decade` argument to the `deareis.mpl.plot_fit` function.
- Added sorting of elements to the `to_dataframe` methods in the `FitResult` and `SimulationResult` classes.
- Updated the required minimum version for `pyimpspec`.
- Fixed a bug where an exception would occur in the GUI program because a `Project` instance created outside of the GUI program would not have a `PlotSettings` instance.
- Fixed bugs that prevented the entries for Kramers-Kronig test results and circuit fit results in the plotting tab from updating properly when deleting those results or when undoing/redoing changes affecting those results.
- Removed `tabulate` as explicit dependency since it was added as an explicit dependency to `pyimpspec`.
