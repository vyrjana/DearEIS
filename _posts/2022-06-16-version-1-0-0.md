## Version 1.0.0

DearEIS has now exited the beta testing phase with the release of [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/vyrjana/DearEIS/releases/tag/1.0.0)!
Large parts of the program have been rewritten to implement features such as user-configurable keybindings.
There is now also a command palette (default keybinding is `Ctrl+P`) that can be used as an alternative way of performing actions without needing to use a mouse and without having to memorize a lot of keybindings.
