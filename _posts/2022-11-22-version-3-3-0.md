## Version 3.3.0

[Link to this release.](https://github.com/vyrjana/DearEIS/releases/tag/3.3.0)

- Added clickable hyperlinks to the `About` window.
- Added the ability to subtract the impedance of a fitted circuit in the `Subtract impedance` window by choosing an existing fit result.
- Updated the `Spectrum` combo in the `Subtract impedance` window to only show other data sets with the same number of points and matching frequencies as the active data set.
- Updated the `Average of multiple data sets` window to only show data sets with the same number of points and matching frequencies as the first data set that is chosen.
- Updated how LaTeX tables are generated when copying, e.g., fitted parameter tables.
- Fixed the BHT method (DRT analysis) so that it works properly when `num_procs` is set to greater than one and NumPy is using OpenBLAS.
