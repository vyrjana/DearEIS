The Z-HIT algorithm ('impedance-Hilbert transformation' or 'Zweipol-Hilbert transformation' depending on the source) reconstructs the modulus data of an impedance spectrum based on the phase data (see references below for more information). The results can be used to check the validity of an impedance spectrum.

For example, the sample's composition may change irreversibly over time and result in an impedance response that changes during a single frequency sweep. This would be most apparent at low frequencies where each data point can take, e.g., several seconds or minutes to measure depending on the frequency. Improper arrangement of the electrode cables can result in mutual induction that becomes apparent at high frequencies and particularly when working with low-impedance samples.

The final step of the Z-HIT algorithm requires an offset adjustment of the reconstructed modulus data, which is done by fitting the reconstructed modulus data to a part of the experimental modulus data. The window settings determine which part of the recorded data is used and 1 Hz to 1000 Hz is typically less affected by artifacts like drift and/or mutual induction.

Note that if some settings are set to 'Auto', then the various combinations are tested and the final result is chosen based on how good the fit is.
