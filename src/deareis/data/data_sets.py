    Extends `pyimpspec.DataSet` to implement data minimization when writing to disk and to recreate the data when loading from disk.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frequencies: Frequencies
        A 1-dimensional array of frequencies in hertz.

    impedances: ComplexImpedances
        A 1-dimensional array of complex impedances in ohms.

    mask: Dict[int, bool], optional
        A mapping of integer indices to boolean values where a value of True means that the data point is to be omitted.

    path: str, optional
        The path to the file that has been parsed to generate this DataSet instance.

    label: str, optional
        The label assigned to this DataSet instance.

    uuid: str, optional
        The universivally unique identifier assigned to this DataSet instance.
        If empty, then one will be automatically assigned.
