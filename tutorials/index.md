Here you can find tutorials covering how to use various features of DearEIS and how to use them.
There are many [hotkeys](settings.md) that can be used for, e.g., more keyboard-centric navigation of the graphical user interface or simply for quickly switching between results.

**IMPORTANT!** The program contains a lot of tooltips with details about what the various settings and buttons do.
Hover the mouse cursor over labels next to settings/buttons or the buttons themselves to see the tooltips.
