## Appearance settings

Several settings related to the appearances of the various plots can be defined.
These settings should make it easier for people with some form of color vision deficiency to use the program.

## Keybindings

Most of the various actions that can be performed in DearEIS (e.g., perform test, switch to the next tab) can be assigned hotkeys.
In some cases there are non-rebindable hotkeys such as `Esc` for closing a modal window.
The `Alt`, `Ctrl`, and `Shift` modifier keys can be used in the keybindings.
A keybinding can be searched for either based on the keys assigned to the keybinding or the description of the action.
